## Introduction

Hello, this is Irving, a software developer proudly working at Devolutions.

I was born in [Yunnan, China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yunnan). Like many other immigrants from this country, I came to Canada as an international student, starting in my last year of high school in Hamilton. A year later, I got accepted into the Business program at Carleton University, which I later found out was not for me. Then, I transferred to the Applied Mathematics program, which was fun but too abstract and lacked practical applications. Hence, I moved to the Math and Computer Science program. I graduated in April 2023. I had a one-year internship at [Snow Software](https://www.snowsoftware.com/) and am currently working at [Devolutions](https://devolutions.net/).

I have experience across multiple fields of Software Development. I have worked on enterprise Java applications, Angular/React/Next.js frontends, and am currently working on Rust/WebAssembly. I am also a self-hosting enthusiast; this blog is hosted on my home lab with my EC2 as an access point. I am an open-minded person with many hobbies. I love poker, snowboarding, and *coding*.

Thank you for your time in reading this. If you are interested in talking to me, please visit [irvingouj.com](https://irvingouj.com). Looking forward to hearing from you.
